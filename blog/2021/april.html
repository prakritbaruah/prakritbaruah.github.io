					<h2>The Dynasties of China</h2>
					<h4><span>Prakrit Baruah, April 2021<span></h4>
				</div>

				<p>
					One of the most confusing aspects of imperialism is how distant European countries came to dominate ancient powerhouses such as India and China. By the 17th century, both countries were responsible for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/the-economic-history-of-the-last-2-000-years-in-1-little-graph/258676/"> around half of the world’s global output </a>. However, by the end of the 19th century, both India and China would be subservient to the West. Pankaj Mishra’s <i>From the Ruins of Empire</i> explains why China, despite a long lineage of organised government and economic success, could not keep up.
					</br></br>
					Mishra looks to Liang Qichao, a journalist and thinker active at the end of Qing-ruled China, to explain why China failed to grasp the European threat. Liang wrote that “for too long China had ‘looked on its country as the world’, and regarded the rest as barbarians.” He elaborated that China’s “civilization ... is the oldest in the world. Three thousand years ago, Europeans were living like beasts in the field, while our civilization, its characteristics pronounced, was already equivalent to theirs of the middle ages.” Liang believed that this surety of supremacy bred complacency. Eventually, an outdated Chinese government and military lost to the dynamism of the European nation states.
					</br></br>
					At first, this may seem surprising given China’s experiences with invasion. The ruling dynasty at the time, the Qing, were of Manchu origin from northern China. Before them, invading Mongols formed the Yuan dynasty. Han Chinese are the largest ethnic group in China, making up <a href="https://guides.lib.unc.edu/china_ethnic/statistics#:~:text=Introducation,regraded%20as%20%22Chinese%20culture%22."> over 92% of the population</a>; despite this, a significant number of ruling dynasties are of non-Han origin. This should undermine the idea that elites did not look beyond China due to their own sense of superiority. However, Mishra claims that invaders often adopted the customs of the Han Chinese. Therefore, Confucian traditions and dynastic rule were never seriously questioned. Only once Europe had dominated China in the “Century of Humiliation” and had wrought numerous concessions from the flailing empire did the literati and ruling classes begin to grapple with foreign ideas such as the modern nation state. By the time of the May 4th movement and the later stance of the CCP, Confucianism had been strongly discredited amongst revolutionaries in favour of robust modernisation in line with Western imperial powers.
