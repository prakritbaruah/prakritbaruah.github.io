					<h2>New York Times Top Terms</h2>
					<h4><span>Prakrit Baruah, October 2020<span></h4>
				</div>

				<p>
				It’s been a pretty eventful year. However, between a sordid presidential election and the relentless march of a pandemic, it’s difficult to remember everything that’s actually happened since last fall. My forgetfulness made me curious: what has occupied our minds most over the past year?
				</br></br>
				Analysing mainstream news content is one way to understand what occupies the most mental real-estate. News both informs and is informed by what matters most to us. So, I looked at the headlines from all New York Times articles since October 2019 to find the most important topics from this year. I split each month into four quarters and plotted the 20 most important terms in each time period. The results brought back some interesting memories.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mt-3">
				What I Found Interesting
				</h4>
				
				<ul>
					<li> The evolution of COVID-19 reporting.
						<ul>
							<li> The rise. Coronavirus was already an important term in 2020-1-Q3 (I remember most people around me, myself included, dismissing the virus at the time). By 2020-2-Q1, the coronavirus had become the number one most important term. 
							<li> The peak. The term “coronavirus” reaches a much higher score in 2020-3-Q2 than any other term throughout the year. I remember avoiding the news around this time because everything was about the coronavirus. The graph quantifies the preponderance this topic had over all others. 
							<li> Our worries. Terms which appeared in articles about the coronavirus show how our hopes and fears have evolved during the pandemic. 2020-3-Q3 indicates a desperation for ventilators; 2020-4-Q3 reveals worries about pregnancy and childbirth; 2020-5-Q3 shows our scepticism of hydroxychloroquine; and the eventual takeover of the term “lockdown” by “reopening” speaks for itself. 
							<li> The fall. In 2020-6-Q3, for the first time in months, the coronavirus was no longer the most important topic in the news. It’s been on and off, though mostly off, the top position since then. Unsurprisingly, we’re starting to think a lot more about the election. 
						</ul>
					<li> Isolation has warped my conception of time. Remember Trump’s impeachment trial and Gordon Sondland? Suleimani? Trump’s wanting to buy Greenland?
					<li> People had some very strong opinions about the Joker movie, released 2019-10-Q1.
				</ul>

				<h4 class="mt-3">
				Some Technical Details
				</h4>

				<p>
				I found the most popular terms and not the most popular words because some words often occur with one another. For example, to separate “Hong” and “Kong” from “Hong Kong” would be meaningless.
				</br></br>
				I used term frequency-inverse document frequency, TF-IDF, to measure the importance of a term in a corpus. This is a bog standard measure of term importance. It assigns the greatest weight to terms that occur often in some documents but not throughout all documents. For example, “and” has a low TF-IDF score despite occurring frequently in a document because it also occurs frequently in every other document. On the other hand, “Beirut” has a high TF-IDF score for 2020-08-Q1 because it was mentioned so often during this one time period (due to the Beirut explosion) and not in other time periods. I group together all headlines in a particular time period and treat this as one “document.” This results in four documents a month and 48 in a year.
